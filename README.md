# greatest-hits
Straight up code samples. As a friend of mine once said, code should be literature, intended for human consumption as well as machine consumption. 

## 2048-clone
A one-day project to replicate the game 2048 in Javascript, using an MVC pattern.

## rational_number.rb
This was a quick challenge to write a Ruby class for rational numbers (expressed as fractions of integers).

## my_enumerable.rb
Working with a pair, we recreated some common Ruby enumerable methods, using only #each.

## sudoku_solver_original.rb
This was a one-day challenge solved by a team of me and three others, to write a recursive algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles.
I've also included a solo refactoring of that code, to make it more DRY/OOP/SRP.

## prime_factors.rb
Iterative and recursive algorithms to calculate prime factors in Ruby. Also a version that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Written with a pair (I think).

## binary_search.rb
Iterative and recursive binary search algorithms in Ruby. Written with a pair.
